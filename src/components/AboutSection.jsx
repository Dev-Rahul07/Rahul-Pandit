        ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rahul Pandit, a passionate Python Developer with hands-on
        experience in Django and full-stack web development. I love turning
        ideas into real-world projects â€” from building web apps to automating
        tasks with Python. Iâ€™ve built multiple projects like a QR Code
        Attendance System, a Expense Tracking App, and a Jarvis-like Voice
        Assistant, using technologies such as Python, Django, MySQL, JavaScript,
        and REST APIs. I recently completed my Python Full Stack Development
        training at PySpiders (Kolkata), where I worked on end-to-end web
        projects, improved my problem-solving skills, and learned to write
        clean, efficient code.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-lg">
        Iâ€™m always excited to learn, collaborate, and grow as a developer â€”
        whether itâ€™s contributing to open-source, building new features, or
        improving system performance. Tech Stack: Python | Django | HTML | CSS |
        JavaScript | React |MySQL | SQLite | Git | REST API
